ENCODING AND RETRIEVAL IN A MODEL OF THE HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 MICROCIRCUIT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This NEURON code implements a small network model (100 pyramidal cells
and 4 types of inhibitory interneuron) of storage and recall of patterns
in the CA1 region of the mammalian hippocampus. Patterns of PC activity
are stored either by a predefined weight matrix generated by Hebbian learning,
or by STDP at CA3 Schaffer collateral AMPA synapses.

Abstract:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease that interferes with many aspects of daily life due to severe cognitive, behavioral, and functional decline, as well as progressive memory loss. In normal healthy adult brains, function and mass do not significantly decline with age. However, brains affected by AD have shown both loss of mass and function (Simic et al. 1997). Since AD is associated with dementia, it is expected that the hippocampus is one of the first areas of the brain to be affected, particularly in the CA1 and CA3 regions (van de Pol et al. 2006). Due to this, the simulation was run with a focus on the CA1, CA3, and the entorhinal cortex’s (EC) roles in creating and recalling “memories,” and how a primitive version of AD following the amyloid hypothesis affects it. To achieve this, a pre-existing model of the hippocampal network centered around the pyramidal cells (PC) of the CA1 microcircuit was modified to have less synapses between EC/CA3 cells and CA1 cells (Spires et al. 2006). 
Patterns were then run through the model network, resulting in measures of the impact of a damaged hippocampus on the brain’s ability to accurately store and recall memories.


To run file in python:
python -i HAM_StoRec_ser.py

To run in Hoc:
Main file: HAM_StoRec_par.hoc (parallel version)
           HAM_StoRec_ser.hoc (serial version - VERY SLOW!)

These files are configured to produce the results presented in figures 9 and 10
of the paper, showing recall of a stored pattern when the entorhinal cortex input
is disconnected from the CA1 pyramidal cells and so pattern recall is cued 
exclusively by CA3 Schaffer collateral input. Example results are in the Results
directory, in which there are also Matlab files for plotting them.
EC input can be restored by setting ECWGT to its non-zero value.
Other results were produced by setting particular connection weight variables to 0
to remove certain synaptic pathways.

*********WARNING******************
// Bug report, V. Cutsuridis and B. Graham, 21 Apr 2015
We have been informed of a bug in the IA mod file,
used for the OLM interneuron first introduced in ModelDB ac. 28316.
Simulations (those for Figs.9 and 10) were thus rerun with the bug fixed.
There are small quantitative differences from the published results, 
but the model still works as described.
To reproduce the published results, comment out the "rates(v)" line in the
DERIVATIVE block of IA.mod.
